I am a Data Analyst who leverages data science techniques to guide strategic decision-making. 

I graduated magna cum laude from Portland State University in 2022, earning a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. Before completing my degree, I gained valuable experience in diverse industries including construction, retail, administration, and accounting.
