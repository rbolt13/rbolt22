I am a data analyst who uses data science and machine learning techniques to extrapolate insight from data. 

I am constantly exploring new topics, and ways to improve upon past and current work.

I graduated magna cum laude with a BS in Mathematics from Portland State University in 2022.

I was born, raised, and am currently based out of Portland, Oregon.

私は日本語を勉強しています。
