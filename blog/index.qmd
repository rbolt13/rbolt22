Hello, and welcome to my new and improved blog made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Github](https://github.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This website is currently under construction so be sure to check out the links below and my [old blog](https://rbolt2.netlify.app/) which showcases all of my academic and personal projects from undergrad.

I post bimonthly about a range of topics that are related to data science, statistics, mathematics, or machine learning. Check out my journey, and feel free to leave my posts comments. I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks for stopping by, and please enjoy!
