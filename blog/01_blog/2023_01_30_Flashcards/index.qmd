# Introduction 

The last couple of data science interviews I went on the first technical interview was a lightning round of "Tell Me What This Is?". These questions included topics regarding machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and data science. To help me get better prepared for these types of interviews I originally thought about creating my own data dictionary. However, those already existed and I wanted something that would be more interactive. That's why instead of a dictionary, I am using quarto to create tabbed panels aka "Flashcards". That way each definition can be hidden or revealed by flipping over the flashcard (aka switching to the "Definition" tab).

All words are sorted alphabetically and will continually update with time. Please let me know in the comments if there's anything you think I should add, or a word you would have defined differently.

:::

# K

::: {.panel-tabset}

### K-Mean Clustering

### Definition 
An unsupervised learning algorithm which groups an unlabeled dataset into clusters with similar properties such as mean. An example might be to group similar customers and then to target them using different types of marketing. 

:::

# L

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Law of Large Numbers

### Definition 
As the sample size increases the mean gets closer to the average of the population. 

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Linear Regression

### Definition 
Uses a liner approach to modeling the relationship between regressor (predictor) variables $x$ and a response variable $y$. 

$$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$$

$$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_nx_n+\epsilon$$

### Neural Network

### Definition 
A type of artificial intelligence that uses connected nodes which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Each node, also known as a neuron, is connected by what is called an edge. Both neurons and edges have a weight that adjusts as the model learns, and can increase or decrease the strength of the signal which travels from the first layer (input) to the last layer (output).

### Snowflake and Start Scheme


### Definition 
Both are logical arrangements of a multidimensional database, where the fact table is in the middle of the structure, and it is surrounded by dimension tables. A **snowflake scheme** has normalized dimension tables meaning there are sub-dimensional tables, whereas a **star schema** is denormalized and easier to  query since there are fewer joins between tables.

# U

### Uneven or Unbalanced Data

### Definition
