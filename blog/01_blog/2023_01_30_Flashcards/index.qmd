# Introduction 

I've recently been applying to and partaking in interviews for remote data science positions all over the country. The last couple of first round technical interviews I went on I was asked a range of questions related to data science, statistics, machine learning, probability, linear algebra, and mathematics. To test myself on answering these types of questions more confidently I created these definitions "Flashcards", which are actually tabset panels, a [component layout](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/layout.html) in quarto. 

Each definition can be viewed by clicking on the "Definition" tab for each word. All words are sorted alphabetically, definitions are  generally casual, words will be continually added, and regularly updating.

# A

::: {.panel-tabset}

### A/B Testing

### Definition 
To compare two versions of something, usually a control (A) and a test variable (B). 

:::

# B

### Bayes Theorem

### Definition 
A method for calculating conditional probability, or the likelihood of one event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. 

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A|B)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{\text{(likelihood)}\times\text{(prior)}}{\text{(evidence)}}$$

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Bias

### Definition 
When a model or statistic doesnâ€™t provide a true representation of the population.

$$bias=\mathbb{E}[f'(x)]-f(x)$$

Bias of the estimated function tells us the capacity of the underlying model to predict the values. 

High bias = overly-simplified model, under-fitting, high error on both testing and training data.

:::

# K

::: {.panel-tabset}

### K-Mean Clustering

### Definition 
An unsupervised learning algorithm which groups an unlabeled dataset into clusters with similar properties such as mean. An example might be to group similar customers and then to target them using different types of marketing.

# L

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Law of Large Numbers

### Definition 
As the sample size increases the mean gets closer to the average of the population. 

:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Linear Regression

### Definition 
Uses a liner approach to modeling the relationship between regressor (predictor) variables $x$ and a response variable $y$. 

$$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\epsilon$$

$$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_nx_n+\epsilon$$

### Definition 
A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns which represent a mathematical expression. 

:::

# N

### Neural Network

### Definition 
A type of artificial intelligence that uses connected nodes which loosely model the neurons in the brain. Each node, also known as a neuron, is connected by what is called an edge. Both neurons and edges have a weight that adjusts as the model learns, and can increase or decrease the strength of the signal which travels from the first layer (input) to the last layer (output).

### Nominal Data

### Definition

### Snowflake and Start Scheme


### Definition 
Both are logical arrangements of a multidimensional database, where the fact table is in the middle of the structure, and it is surrounded by dimension tables. A **snowflake scheme** has normalized dimension tables meaning there are sub-dimensional tables, whereas a **star schema** is denormalized and easier to  query since there are fewer joins between tables.

### Type 1 and Type 2 Error

### Definition

:::

# U

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Uneven or Unbalanced Data

### Definition
