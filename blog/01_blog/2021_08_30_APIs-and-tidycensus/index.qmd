This post explains how to use an API to access tidycensus. 

![](../../00_img/tidycensus.png)

# `1. Set-up`

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE) 
```

To start [Request a Key](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to get an API key. 

Then create an .Renviron file to your projects main directory with "CENSUS_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX", where all the X's represent you key. 

Note: 

* This key will not work with spaces on either side of the equal sign.

* tidycensus already has this utility worked into it (read ?census_api_key). They call their api key CENSUS_API_KEY (it is common for this key to be in all caps), so that is what I also called mine. This will be especially helpful in not mixing up API keys if I use other API keys in the future. 

Now load the `tidycensus` package and use `readRenviron()` to access the API key. 

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
base::readRenviron("../../.Renviron")
```

Note: 

* The first time you access your API key you may want to reload your environment so you don't have to restart R. 

* `../` tells your machine to go one folder outside the folder it is in. 

* Use `Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")` to check your key is accesible and correct.

# `2. Using tidycensus`

Use `load_variables(year, dataset, chache=T/F)` for various data sets. Read `?load_variables()` for more information. 

Note:

* **label** shows the estimates by total, and then sex and age range.

* **concept** is by sex, then race, origins, and ancestry.  

```{r}
a <- tidycensus::load_variables(2019, "acs1")
utils::head(a, 10)
```

Let's only focus on the first line for now, "B01001_001" which should be the total estimates. Then we can use `get_acs()` to get data population data by state from the American Community Survey.

```{r}
b <- tidycensus::get_acs(geography = "state", year = 2019, variable = "B01001_001")
utils::head(b, 10)
```

We can get similar population estimates setting the variable = c("POP), with get_estimates. As well as "DENSITY"; for housing unit estimates, c("HUEST"); and for components of change estimates, c("BIRTHS", "DEATHS", "DOMESTICMIG", "INTERNATIONALMIG", "NATURALINC", "NETMIG", "RBIRTH", "RDEATH", "RDOMESTICMIG", "RINTERNATIONALMIG", "RNATURALINC", "RNETMIG").

```{r}
c <- tidycensus::get_estimates(geography = "state", year = 2019, variable = c("POP"))
utils::head(c, 10)
```


```{r}
d <- tidycensus::get_estimates(geography = "county", state = "OR", year = 2019, variable = c("POP"))
utils::head(d, 10)
```
