# `1. Order`

**Order**: Let $a\in G$. The $\underline{\text{order}}$ of a, denoted ord(a) or $|a|$, is the least positive integer n such that $a^n=e$. 

## `Theorems`

**Theorem 3**: Let G be a group and let $a\in G$ have order $n<\infty$. Then every power of a is equal to exactly one $e,a,a^2,a^3,...,a^{n-1}$

**Corollary**: Let ord(a)=$n<\infty$. Then the cyclic group generated by a has n elements. $\langle a\rangle=\{...,a^{-2},a^{-1},e,a,a^2,a^3\}=\{e,a,a^2,...,a^{n-1}\}$. 

**Theorem 4**: Let ord(a)=$\infty$. Then for all $i,j\in\mathbb{Z}$, if $i\in j$ then $a^i\ne a^j$. 

(No power of a gives the identity, and no power of a is the same.)

**Corollary**: If ord(a)=$\infty$, the cyclic group generated by a has infintely many elements: $\langle a\rangle =\{...,a^{-2},a^{-1},e,a,a^{2},...\}$

**Theorem 5**: Let $a\in G$ have order $n<\infty$. Then $a^m=e$ if and only if m is a multiple of n. 

# `2. Cyclic Groups (Ch. 11)`

**Theorem 1**: 

a. Every cyclic group of size $n<\infty$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$

b. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$

**Theorem 2**: Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. 

**Theorem 3**: A group of size n is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order n. 

**Greatest Common Divisor**: $\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n\cong \mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1.

## `Facts about Cyclic Groups`

Let $G=\langle a\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,...,a^{n-1}\}$ be a cyclic group of size n. 

1. G is abelian (Since $a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^{j}a^{i}$)

2. Let $k\geq 1$ be a positive divisor of $|G|=n$. Then G has exactly one subgroup of size k. 

3. The subgroup of G of size 1 is $\langle e\rangle =\{e\}$. If $k>1$ is a divisor of n, the subgorup of size k is $\langle a^{n/k}\rangle$

# `3. Counting Cosets (Ch. 13)`

## `Definitions`

**coset**: Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. For any $a\in G$, the set $Ha=\{ha|h\in H\}.$ This is a (right) $\underline{\text{coset}}$ of H in G. 

**index**: The number of cosets of H in G, n, is called the $\underline{\text{index}}$ of H in G. 

## `Facts about Cosets`

1. All cosets have the same size as H. 

2. Distinct cosets don't overlap. 

3. Every element of G is in some coset of H. 

4. How should we choose a so that we don't get repeated cosets? Choose a to be an element of G that hasn't yet appeared in a coset. 

5. How do we know when we've listed all cosets? We're done when every element of G has appeared in a coset.

## `Theorems`

**Lemma**: Distinct cosets don't overlap. 

**Corollary**: If $a\in Hb$ then $Ha=Hb$.

**Theorem 1**: The set $\{Ha|a\in G\}$ of all cosets of H is a partiion of G. 

**Corollary**: Define a relation $\sim$ on G by $a\sim b$ iff a and b are in the same coset of H. 

**Theorem 2**: Every coset of H in G has the same size as H. 

**Lagrange's Theorem**: Let G be a finite group and H be a subgroup of G. Then the size of H divides the size of G. 

**Theorem 4**: Let $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ be prime. If $|G|=p$, then $G\cong\mathbb{Z}_p$. 

**Theorem 5**: Let G be a finite group and $a\in G$. Then ord(a) divides $|G|$.

# `4. Homomorphisms and Normal Subgroups (Ch. 14)`

## `Definitions`

**Homomorphism**: Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups. A $\underline{\text{homomorphism}}$ is a function $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ such that for all $a,b\in G_1$, $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$.

**Homomorphic Image**: If $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ is an onto homomorphism, we call $G_2$ a $\underline{\text{homomorphic image}}$ of $G_1$. 

**Kernel**: Let $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ be a homomorphism. The $\underline{\text{kernel}}$ of f is the set of all elements in $G_1$ that get sent to $e_2\in G_2$: $\text{ker}(f)=\{x\in G_1|f(x)=e_2\}.$

**Conjugate**: Let G be a group and $g_1x\in G$. The element $gxg^{-1}$ is called the $\underline{\text{conjugate}}$ of x by g. Going from x to $gxg^{-1}$ is called $\underline{\text{conjugation by g}}$.

**Normal**: Let H be a subgroup of G. We call H a $\underline{\text{normal}}$ subgroup of G if for all $g\in G$ and $h\in H$, the conjugate $ghg^{-1}$ is in H. Notation: $H \unlhd G$

**Normal Subgroup**: A subgroup H of G is called a $\underline{\text{normal subgroup}}$ if for all $g\in G$ and $h\in H$. $ghg^{-1}\in H$.

## `Theorems`

**Theorem 1**: Let $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ be a homomorphism. Then 

(i) $f(e_1)=e_2$

(ii) $f(a^{-1})=[f(a)]^{-1}\forall a\in G_1$

**Theorem**: Let $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ be a homomorphism. Then f is one-to-one if and only if ker(f)=$\{e_1\}$.

**Theorem**: If G is abelian, every subgroup of G is normal. 

**Theorem**: Let H be a subgroup of G. Then H is normal in G if and only if $aH=Ha$ for all $a\in G$. 

**Theorem**: A subgroup H of G is normal in G iff $aH=Ha\forall a\in G$. 

**Theorem 2**: Let $f:G_1\rightarrow G_2$ be a homomorphism. 

(i) ran(f)=$\{f(x)|x\in G_1\}$ is a subgroup of $G_2$

(ii) ker(f) is a normal subgroup of $G_1$.

# `5. Quotient Groups (Ch. 15)`

**coset multiplication**: $Ha\cdot Hb=H(ab)$ or $(H+a)+(H+b)=H+(a+b)$

## `Theorems`

**Theorem 2**: Let H be a normal subgroup of G. If $Ha=Hc$ and $Hb=Hd$, then $H(ab)=H(cd)$.

**Theorem 3**: Let H be a normal subgroup of G. The set $G/H=\{Ha|a\in G\}$

**Theorem 4**: Let H be a normal subgroup of G. The function $f:G\rightarrow G/H$ define by $$f(a)=Ha$$ is a surjective homomorphsim with kernel H.

**Theorem 5**: Let H be a subgroup of G. 

(i) $Ha=Hb$ if and only if $ab^{-1}\in H$.

(ii) $Ha=H$ if and only if $a\in H$. 

# `6. The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem`

## `Theorems`

**Theorem 1**: Let $f:G\rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism with kernel K. Then $f(a)=f(b) \Leftrightarrow Ka=Kb$.

**Theorem 2**: Let $f:G\rightarrow H$ be a surjective (onto) homomorphism with kernel K. Then $G/K\cong H$.
