This post composes a short data set of 13 ballets, and then creates a table with clickable links, and an interactive graph with plotly.

# `0.` Introduction 

Ballet has been a popular form of dance and culture since the fifteen hundreds^[[A Breif History of Ballet](https://www.atlantaballet.com/resources/brief-history-of-ballet)]. It has changed and evolved a lot since then, but for this analysis I thought it would be fun to investigate some of the most popular ballets. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

### `0.1 Set Up` 

I will use the following packages: 

* `dplyr` to manipulate the data.

* `lubridate` to convert the date character in a date variable.

* `purr` to use map function for links. 

* `gt` to make the table. 

* `ggplot2` to make the graph.

* `plotly` to make the graph interactive. 

```{r, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
library(gt) 
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

### `0.2 Collect Data` 

To build this data from scratch, I started with 13 different popular ballets. 

```{r}
Ballet <- c("Swan Lake", 
            "The Nutcracker", 
            "Giselle", 
            "Romeo and Juliet",  
            "Don Quixote", 
            "Cinderella ", 
            "La Bayadere", 
            "Coppelia", 
            "The Sleeping Beauty ", 
            "La Sylphide ", 
            "Spartacus", 
            "Alice's Adventures in Wonder Land",
            "Firebird")
```

Using Wikipedia I am including:

* Composers

```{r}
Composer <- c("Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", 
              "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky",
              "Adolph Adam", 
              "Sergei Prokofiev",
              "Ludwig Minkus",
              "Sergei Prokofiev",
              "Ludwig Minkus",
              "Leo Delibes",
              "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky",
              "Filippo Talioni",
              "Leonid Yakobson",
              "Joby Talbo",
              "Igor Stravinsky ")
```

* Choreographers

Note ballets with only one choreographer will show the second choreographer as blank. 

```{r}
choreographer_1 <- c("Julius Reisinger",
                     "Marius Petipa", 
                     "Jean Coralli",
                     "Ivo Vana-Psota",
                     "Marius Petipa", 
                     "Rosstislav Zakharov",
                     "Marius Petipa",
                     "Arthur Saint-Leon",
                     "Marius Petipa",
                     "Jean-Madeline Schnitzhoeffer",
                     "Aram Khachaturian",
                     "Christopoher Wheeldon",
                     "Michel Fokine")
choreographer_2 <- c("",
                     "Lev Ivanov",
                     "Jules Perrot",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "",
                     "")
```

* Number of Acts

```{r}
Acts <- c(4, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1)
```

* Date Premiered

```{r}
month_premiered <- c( 3, 12, 6, 12, 12, 11, 2, 5, 1, 3, 12, 2, 6)
day_premiered <- c( 4, 18, 28, 30, 26, 21, 11, 25, 5, 12, 27, 28, 9)
year_premiered <- c(1877, 1892, 1841, 1938, 1869, 1945, 1877, 1870, 1890, 1832, 1956, 2011, 1910)
```

* Links to Youtube Videos of each Ballet

```{r}
Links <- c("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbUatYSm8ME", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR_Z1LUDQuQ", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VroMXEDLTq8", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AnpPu7j6Dg",  
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pazAS4cNi7w", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPbKZXNfJ-Y", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTR4Oco_0Bc", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE2fjFMag7E", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDFlRq5RnbQ", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_RFxSLar2A", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fha6rYtaLMk", 
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2wWq25p5Sk",
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo9L9H--t3k")
```

### `0.3 Create Data Frame`

For the ballet dataframe, ballet_df, I will use:

* `make_date()` to make the character variables a date. 

* `arrange()` to arrange the df alphabetically by Ballet. 

I also did not include choreographer_2, because it only provided two data points which did not contribute a lot to this short analysis. 

```{r}
ballet_df <- base::data.frame(
  Ballet,
  Composer,
  choreographer_1,
  Acts,
  date_premiered = lubridate::make_date(year_premiered,
                                        month_premiered,
                                        day_premiered)) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Ballet)
```

### `1.1 Code for Table`

To add the hyper-linked text I used: 

* `mutate()` to overwrite exsiting variables. 

* `map()` to transform the input into an object of the same length. 

* `a()` to create an R object that represents an HTML hyperlink tag. 

* `.x` stands for the vector that is being input. 

* `html()` so the HTML tag will come through as HTML when rendered. 

* `as.character()` to convert the input to a character. 

To create the table I used:

* `gt()` to create the table. 

```{r}
ballet_table <- ballet_df %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      Links = map(Links, ~ htmltools::a(href = .x, "Youtube")),
      Links = map(Links, ~ gt::html(as.character(.x)))) %>%
    gt::gt()
```

### `1.2 Code for Interactive Plot`

To create a ggplot I used:

* `ggplot()` to create the plot, and define the mapping.

* `geom_point()` to create a scatterplot. 

* `labs()` to define the labels. 

* `ggtitle` to define the title. 

```{r}
ballet_plot <- ballet_df %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date_premiered, 
                                y = Ballet, 
                                color = factor(Acts))) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Date Premiered", 
                y = "Ballet", 
                color = "Number of Acts") +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Ballets by Date Premiered")
```
