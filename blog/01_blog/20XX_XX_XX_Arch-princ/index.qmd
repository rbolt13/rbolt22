Prove the following corollary of Archimedean Principle.

For every positive real number $\epsilon$, there exists a positive integer N such that 1/n \< $\epsilon$ for all $n\geq N$. (Note: this exercise is the basis for the formal proof that the sequence \${\$1, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{4}$,...$\}$ converges to 0.)
