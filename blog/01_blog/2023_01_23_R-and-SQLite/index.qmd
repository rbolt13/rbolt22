Using a R package called SQLite, this post demonstrates how to answer data related questions with both R and SQL (Structured Query Language).

# `0.` Introduction 

There are a handful of programming languages that data scientists use when querying, analyzing, and manipulating data. What I have found is that while R and Python have a lot more power in what they are capable of producing, SQL is used by a wider variety of roles to access and query data. So to get more practice using both SQL and R I pulled 10 questions and some data off a website called [Learn SQL](https://www.sql-practice.com/), and will be answering the following questions in both languages. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

### `0.0 Set-Up`

**Contents:**

* 0.1 Packages

* 0.2 Data

* 0.3 Data base

### `0.1 Packages`

For all my data queries and manipulation in R I will be using base R, [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), and [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html).

```{r R packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```

To create a SQL database, and run SQL queries in R chunks I will be using a package called [RSQLite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html). 

```{r SQLite package}
# install.packages("RSQLite")
library(RSQLite)
```

### `0.2 Data` 

This post will use three data sets that I copied from [Learn SQL](https://www.sql-practice.com/): 

1. `patients`: Which includes patient_id, first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city, province_id, allergies, height, and weight. Note I only copied the first 1000 entries. 

```{r patients data}
patients <- utils::read.csv('data/patients.csv')
```

2. `province_names`: Which includes province_id, and province_name. 

```{r province_names data}
province_names <- utils::read.csv("data/province_names.csv")
```

3. `admissions`: which includes patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id

```{r admissions data}
admissions <- utils::read.csv("data/admissions.csv")
```


### `0.3 Database`  

To create a database use: 

* `dbConnect()` to connect to a SQL data base called Hospital.db in the 00_data folder. 

* `SQLite()` to connect to a SQLite database file. 

```{r}
hosp <- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),
                           "data/Hospital.db")
```

To define data within the database use:

* `dbWriteTable()` to create a data set within the hospital database first call the data base (hosp), define a name, and then define the data. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
RSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,
                      "patients",
                      patients)
RSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,
                      "province_names",
                      province_names)
RSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,
                      "admissions",
                      admissions)
```

Verify the three data sets are in the database using:

* `dbListTables()` to list the tables within the hosp database. 

```{r}
RSQLite::dbListTables(hosp)
```

:::

# `1.` Show the first ten rows of patients data.

### `1.0`

**Contents**

* 1.1 Solution in R

* 1.2 Solution in SQL

### `1.1 R`

In R use:

* `head()` to view the first 10 rows of the patients data.

```{r}
utils::head(patients, 10)
```

### `1.2 SQL`

In R use: 

* `dbGetQuery()` to run SQL commands from a given data base.

In SQL use:

* `SELECT` to select. 

* `*` to include all columns. 

* `FROM` to define the patients data for select to include all columns from. 

* `LIMIT` to only show the top ten rows. 

```{r}
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(hosp, 
                    "SELECT * 
                     FROM patients 
                     LIMIT 10"
                    )

```

### `2.2 SQL`

In SQL use:

* `SELECT` to select. 

* `COUNT(*)` to count the total number of rows.

* `AS` to define that count as a new variable, total_admissions.

```{r}
RSQLite::dbGetQuery(hosp,
                    "SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_admissions 
                     FROM patients"

```{r}
utils::head(
  base::data.frame(
    full_name = base::paste0(patients$first_name, 
                             " ",
