This is a "presentation" style proof for Math-338: Modern College Geometry, and looks at congruence of two verticle angles.

## Suppose two angles are verticle. 

Prove that they are congruent.

# `1.` Definitions

Before hopping into our proof, lets look at a few definitions with some [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry) images. 

## `1.1` Vertical Angles

In class we defined vertical angles as being "across from each other". 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 1: ** Vertical angles are shown in pink.'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../00_img/q1_img1.png")
```

We can see a simple example of this in **Fig. 1** where a pair of pink angles $\angle AOB$ and $\angle COD$ are vertical to each other. 

Note that $\angle AOC$ and $\angle BOD$ are vertical angles as well.

## `1.2` Congruence

$x\cong y$ if there is an $\underline{\text{isometry}}$ that superimposes x onto y. 

- Isometry is a map that preserves distance and angles 

  - translation (move without turning)
  
  - rotation (moving about a fixed point)
  
  - reflection (mirror)
  
  - combination 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 2: ** Two congruent triangles'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../00_img/q1_img3.png")
```

In **Fig. 2** we see the two triangles are congruent, and would only need a translation isometry or two to map $\triangle ABC$ onto $\triangle A_1B_1C_1$.

## `1.3` Supplementary Angles

We defined supplementary angles as angles whose measurement adds up to $180^\circ$.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 3: **Supplementary angles are shown in pink and orange.'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../00_img/q1_img2.png")
```

 In **Fig.3** we can clearly see that $m\angle AOC$ shown in pink and $m\angle AOB$ in orange adds to a straight line or $180^\circ$. We can also see three other pairs of supplementary angles: 

- $m\angle AOB+m\angle BOD=180^\circ$

- $m\angle BOD+m\angle COD=180^\circ$

- $m\angle COD+m\angle AOC=180^\circ$

# `2.` Theroems

Included are the axioms and theorems used to prove that two vertical angles are congruent. 

## `2.1` Axioms of Angle Measure

1. Right angle measures $90^\circ$

2. $m\angle ABC=m\angle CBA$

3. If D is the interior of $\angle ABC$, then $m\angle ABC=m\angle ABD+m\angle BDC$

4. There exists a **unique** ray that is the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$. 

## `2.2` Congruence and Angle Measure theorem

$\angle ABC\cong \angle DEF \Leftrightarrow m\angle ABC=m\angle DEF$

1. If two angles are congruent then the measure of those two angles is the same. 

2. If the measure of two angles is the same, then those two angles are congruent. 

(Note that the measure for angles that will be used on the proof will be in degrees. )

## `2.3` Supplementary Interior Angle Theorem 

If two lines are parallel then the supplementary interior angles add to $180^\circ$. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 4: ** Supplementary interior angles are shown in red.'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../00_img/q1_img4.png")
```

In **Fig. 4** the supplementary interior angles $\angle AEF$ and $\angle CFE$ are shown in red and add up to $180^\circ$. 

# `3.` Proof

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 1: **Two intesecting lines segments form vertical angles, shown in pink.'}
knitr::include_graphics("../../00_img/q1_img1.png")
```

To prove that two vertical angles are congruent, we need to prove two things :

1. $\angle AOB\cong \angle COD\Rightarrow m\angle AOB = m\angle COD$

2. $m\angle AOB = m\angle COD\Rightarrow \angle AOB\cong \angle COD$

$\underline{\text{Proof}}$: 

1. $\angle AOB\cong \angle COD\Rightarrow m\angle AOB = m\angle COD$

Suppose $\angle AOB\cong \angle COD$. 

Then there is an isometry that superimposes $\angle AOB$ onto $\angle COD$. 

Let $f$ be that isometry : $f(\angle AOB)=\angle COD$.

Isometries preserve angle. 

The angle measure of $f(\angle AOB)$ equals the angle measure of $\angle COD$. 

So by substitution $m\angle AOB=m\angle COD$. 

2. $m\angle AOB = m\angle COD\Rightarrow \angle AOB\cong \angle COD$

Suppose $m\angle AOB = m\angle COD$. 

Since by definition of vertical angles, $\angle AOB$ and $\angle COD$ are across from each other, there is a reflection, $f(m\angle AOB)$ about the origin (O). 

We also know that there are four pairs of supplementary angles, two of which are: 

- $m\angle AOB+m\angle BOD=180^\circ$

- $m\angle BOD+m\angle COD=180^\circ$

So, $m\angle AOB+m\angle BOD=m\angle BOD+m\angle COD$. 

And if we subtract $m\angle BOD$ from both sides we get, $m\angle AOB=m\angle COD$. 

It would then make sense that $f(O)=O$, $f(A)=C$, and $f(B)=D$. 

Then by definition of reflection $f(m\angle AOB)=m\angle COD$. 

Therefore by the Congruence and Angle measure theorem $\angle AOB\cong \angle COD$.

$\square$
