When it comes to project organization, the majority of available content simply emphasizes the use of Github. However, true project organization extends beyond version control. In this blog post, I explore two distinct methods of organizing data projects, which prioritize streamlined data analysis and reduce the need for excessive attention to intricate project architecture.

# Misleading Advice 

Before delving into the methods of project organization, it is essential to address some misleading advice that can lead to wasted time, frustration, and ultimately deviate from practical usage. 

One common misleading suggestion is to number your files. Despite numerous attempts and variations, I have consistently encountered several issues with this approach. Firstly, most data projects do not adhere to a sequential file path, making numbered files impractical. Furthermore, scaling a project can be problematic when relying on numbered files, and renaming files after code has been written can be troublesome and time consuming. In the latter part of this post, I will explore a more effective method for naming files, which eliminates the need for renaming to fit into a predefined assembly line. 

Another piece of misleading advice revolves around different methods of code commenting. While countless variations of this suggestion exist, the majority tend to be excessive. Instead a better approach is to write comments that immediately convey the purpose of the file, ensuring that it is easily reproducible, and tailored to its specific function within the project’s structure. When a project’s design is intentional, comments can transform the entire project into a flexible and structured “Choose Your Own Adventure” experience, rather than a rigid checklist accompanied by a 30 line manual for each file.
