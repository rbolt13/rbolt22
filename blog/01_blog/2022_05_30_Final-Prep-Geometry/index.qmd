# `1. Euclidean Geometry` 

- Euclid's 5th Axiom

- Triangle Congruence: SAS, ASA, SSS, AAS

- Angles and Parallel Lines

   - vertical angels are congruent
   
   - corresponding angles are congruent
   
   - alternate interior angles are congruent 
   
   - supplementary angles add to $180^\circ$ 
   
**Quadrilaterals**: 4 sided figure in the plane, where the edges are straight lines. 

**Parallelogram**: Both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. 

**Trapezoid**: At least 1 pair of opposite sides are parallel. 

**Rhombus**: Parallelogram, all sides are same length. 

**Rectangle**: Parallelogram whose internal angles are all right angles.

**Square**: Rectangle whose sides are all equal length. 

**Parallelogram Theorem**: Let ABCD be a parallelogram. Then the following are equivalent:

1. ABCD is a parallelogram. (opposite sides are parallel)

2. $\angle DAB \cong \angle BCD$ and $\angle ABC\cong \angle CDA$ (angles that are across from each other are congruent)

3. $AB=CD$ and $BC=DA$ (opposite sides have equal measure)

4. $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ bisect each other. (diagnals bisect each other)

**Axioms of Area**:

1. To every polygonal region (space enclosed by straight lines in the plane) there corresponds a unique positive number called $\underline{area}$. 

2. If 2 tirangles are congruent their areas are equal. 

3. If $R=R_1\cup R_2$ and $R_1\cap R_2$ is a finite number of segments or points, then the area of $R$ is the sum of the areas of $R_1+R_2$. 

4. The area of a rectangle is its base times its height.

# `2. Similarity`

**Dilation**: shrink or expand by a scaling factor, k,  from a center point, P. 

**Similarity**: 2 figures are similar if one can be superimposed on the other by a dilation and a sequence of isometries. 

- AA, SAS

# `3. Circles`

**Circle:** center, radius 

Points on circle have distance r from the center point O. 

**Unit Circle:** radius length 1.

**Arc:** a connected subset of the points on circle.

**Chord:** line segment connecting 2 points on circle. 

**Central Angle:** vertex is center of circle, rays intersect in 2 different points. (pie slice)

**Inscribed Angles** vertex is on circle, rays intersect circle in 2 points. 

**Inscribed:** verities on circle. 

For an inscribed square, all four points of a square are on the circle.

**Tangent Line:** Line that intersects circle at only 1 point. 

**Radian:** measure of the central angle in a unit circle with arc length of 1. 

**Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half of a centeral angle that subtends the same arc. 

**Corollary**: Any two inscribed angles have the same arc on the circle are congruent. 

**Power of the Point Theorem 1**: If $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are chords of circle intersecting in x inside a circle. Then $Ax\cdot xB=Cx\cdot xD$

**Power of the Point Theorem 2**: LEt P be a point outside a given circle. Suppose we draw two rays from the point P: one ray intersects the circle at points A and B (in that order), and the other intersects the circle at the points C and D (in that order). Then $PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$

# `4. Isometries and Symmetries`

The set of isometries with composition is a group: 

0. Closure

1. Associativity 

2. Identity 

3. Inverses

**Symmetry** A symmetry is an isometry that sends a geometric figure to itself. 

- 6 symmetries of an equilateral triangle

- 8 symmetries of a square 

- 2n symmetries of a regular polygon

# `5. Taxicab Geometry`

**Euclidean Distance**: $d_E(A,B)=\sqrt{(x_B-x_A)^2+(y_B-y_A)^2}$

- $\pi\approx 3.14$

**Taxicab Distance**: $d_T=|x_B-x_A|+|y_B-y_A|$

- $\pi = 4$

Isometries for taxicab (traingles):

- translations

- rotations by $90^\circ k$ where k is an integer

- combinations

# `6. Spherical Geometry`

No parallel may be drawn through a point not on a given line.

**Equation of a Sphere**: $S^2=\{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3|x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2\}$

- great circles are straight lines (equator and longitudes)

**Distance of a Sphere**: $d_s(A,B)=\rho\cdot\text{arc cos}(\frac{A\cdot B}{\rho ^2})$

**Triangle Angle Measurements**

- Can have three right angles 

- All three angles added together will be greater than $180^\circ$

**Area of a Sphere**: $\rho^2\cdot E$ (where the excess $E=\alpha+\beta+\gamma-180^\circ$)

Consider the surface area of a sphere to be $4\pi\rho^2$, then the area of a triangle on a sphere will be a proportion of that. 


# `7. Hyperbolic Geometry`

More than one parallel may be drawn through a point not on a given line. 

**Inversions about a circle**

- preserve angles (conformal)

**Cross Ratio**: Given four distinct points (A,B,C,D) in the plane, the cross ratio is define $(A,B;C,D)=\frac{AC\cdot BD}{BC\cdot AD}$
