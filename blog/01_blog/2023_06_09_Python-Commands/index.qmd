# Introduction 

The information provided here is based on the YouTube video titled "[Python Tutorial: VENV (Mac & Linux) - How to Use Virtual Environments with the Built-In venv Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1Yvry_Ydk)" by [Corey Schafer](http://coreyms.com/).

Note: Remember not to commit the virtual environment (venv) and include it in the .gitignore file. However, do commit the requirements.txt file for package version control.

Let's dive into the essential Python commands:

# 1. Checking Installed Packages in the Global Environment

To view the list of packages installed on your machine in the global environment, execute the following command in your terminal:

```{r}
#| eval: false
pip3 list
```


# 2. Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
python3 -m venv project_name
```

# 3. Creating a Virtual Environment in a Project Folder

It's important to avoid placing your project files within the virtual environment. Instead, create the virtual environment in a project folder by executing the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
python3 -m venv project_folder/project_name
```

# 4. Activating the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, run the appropriate command based on your operating system:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
activate virtual enviroment
```

# 5. Checking the Python Version in the Virtual Environment

To determine the Python version being used within the virtual environment, use the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
which python
```

# 6. Checking Installed Packages in the Virtual Environment

To view the packages installed within the virtual environment, execute the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
pip list
```

# 7. Installing Packages in the Virtual Environment

To install packages within the virtual environment, use the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
pip install package_name
```

# 8. Creating a File of Packages and Versions

To create a file containing a list of installed packages and their versions, use the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

# 9. Installing Packages from a Requirements File

To install packages from a requirements file, execute the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 10. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the global environment, use the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
deactivate 
```

# Conclusion

These basic Python commands provide a solid foundation for managing virtual environments and package installations. By utilizing virtual environments, you can isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent and reproducible development environments. Remember to create and commit a requirements.txt file for version control of your project's dependencies, while excluding the virtual environment itself from version control.
