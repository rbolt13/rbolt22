This post uses the r package reactable to look at 2022 NBA Finals contenders: Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics. 

![](../../00_img/gsw-bs-22-final.jpeg)

```{r options, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=FALSE,
                      message= FALSE,
                      warning=FALSE)
```

# `1.` Set Up

This post will use three packages:

* rvest: to harvest the data.

* dplyr: to join and tidy data. 

* reactable: to make interactive tables. 

```{r set up}
library(rvest) 
library(dplyr)
library(reactable)
```

# `2.` Havest the Data with rvest

Using data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and the rvest package I can harvest current data without having to save CSV's.  For this table I will be pulling in the final two teams which competed in the 2022 NBA Finals: 

* Golden State Warriors 

* Boston Celtics

```{r}
# team name
gsw <- "Golden State Warriors"
bc <- "Boston Celtics"

# team slug
gsw_slug <- "GSW"
bc_slug <- "BOS"

# url
gsw_url <- base::paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/",
                        gsw_slug,"/2022.html")
bc_url <- base::paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/",
                       bc_slug,"/2022.html")
```

There is a lot of data available on [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), but for this table I will only be looking at each teams 2022 total stats. 

```{r rvest data}
# harvest data
gsw_ttl_stat <- gsw_url %>%
  read_html %>%
  html_node("#totals") %>% 
  html_table()

bc_ttl_stat <- bc_url %>%
  read_html %>%
  html_node("#totals") %>% 
  html_table()
# look at data
utils::head(gsw_ttl_stat)
utils::head(bc_ttl_stat)
```

# `3.` Tidy Data

To tidy the data I want to do 3 things:

1. Rename column 2 to 'Name'.

2. Add a column with the team name.

3. Join two tables into one. 

```{r tidy data}
# remane 
base::names(gsw_ttl_stat)[2] <- "Name"
base::names(bc_ttl_stat)[2] <- "Name"

# add column
gsw_ttl_stat$Team <- gsw
bc_ttl_stat$Team <- bc

# merge tables
total_stats <- dplyr::full_join(gsw_ttl_stat, bc_ttl_stat)

#view data  
utils::head(total_stats)
total_stats
```

# `4.` Reactable

Now to make a simple reactable I will do 7 things:

1. Group by "Team" name. 

2. Define column names. 

3. Include boarders around the table and every cell.  

4. Include highlight rows that are hovered over.  

5. Make filterable. 

6. Make Searchable. 

7. Have the two teams be the minimum number of rows initally shown. 

```{r reactable}
reactable(
  total_stats,
  groupBy = "Team",
  columns = list(
    Rk = colDef(name = "Rank"),
    G = colDef(name = "Games"),
    MP = colDef(name = "Minutes Played"),
    FG = colDef(name = "Field Goals"),
    `3P` = colDef(name = "3 Point Goals"),
    `2P` = colDef(name = "2 Point Goals"),
    FT = colDef(name = "Free Throws"),
    AST = colDef(name = "Assists"),
    STL = colDef(name = "Steals"),
    BLK = colDef(name = "Blocks"),
    PTS = colDef(name = "Points"),
    TOV = colDef(name = "Turnovers"),
    PF = colDef(name = "Personal Fouls")
  ),
  bordered = TRUE,
  highlight = TRUE,
  filterable = TRUE,
  searchable = TRUE,
  minRows = 2
  )
```
