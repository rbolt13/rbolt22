**About**

I am a data analyst / scientist based out of Portland, Oregon.

I have been writing about mathematics, statistics, and data science in my blog since 2021. 

I am constantly exploring new topics, and ways to improve upon past and current work. 

I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Portland State University in 2022.
