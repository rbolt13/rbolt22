**Professional**

I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Portland State University in 2022 with an emphasis on statistics. Since most of my undergrad was during COVID-19 lock down I've become proficient at collaborating remotely. I ran remote study groups through discord, participated in the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) club, spoke virtually at [G.I.S. in Action](https://gisinaction2021.sched.com/directory/speakers), and in the summer of 2021 created my first blog.

Currently I am looking for work as a data analyst, data scientist, or a machine learning engineer. My hope is that this blog will not only showcase my technical skills in these areas, but also my determination, adaptability, and perseverance.

**Personal**

:ballet_shoes: Before I went to back to school to get my degree in mathematics I was a dancer. I have trained pre-professionally at [Dance Vision](https://www.dancevisionusa.com/) and [The SanFrancisco Conservatory of Dance](https://sfcdblog.wordpress.com/). My favorite dance styles are ballet, hip-hop, and modern, but I love all kinds of dance and will try any form of movement. I unfortunately an not able to dance as much anymore due to a car accident in 2014 which required me to have two separate jaw surgeries in 2016 and 2017.

:jp: In high school I took Japanese, and have been appreciative of the culture ever since. Recently I bought plane tickets to visit Japan for the first time for my 30th birthday in 2023. While I'd still consider myself a beginner at speaking, writing, and reading the language, I am very much looking forward to the experience.

:basketball: I enjoy most sports, but especially soccor and basketball. It's a great way to do hobby statistics, and get rowdy :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Growing up both of my sisters, and dad played basketball so I watched a lot of games, and I still enjoy watching the NBA and WNBA. My favorite NBA teams are the Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, and New Orleans Pelicans. 

:video_game: I have a switch, and when I am not working on my blog I play [Stardew Valley](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/stardew-valley-switch/), [Cat Cafe Manager](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/cat-cafe-manager-switch/), [Unpacking](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/unpacking-switch/), [Mario Carts](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch/), [Pokemon Legends Arceus](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/pokemon-legends-arceus-switch/), [Animal Crossing](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/), and most recently [Just Dance](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/just-dance-switch/).
