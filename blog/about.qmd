**Professional**

I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Portland State University in 2022. Since most of my undergrad was during COVID-19 lock down I've become proficient at collaborating remotely. I ran remote study groups through discord, participated in the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) club, spoke virtually at [G.I.S. in Action](https://gisinaction2021.sched.com/directory/speakers), and in the summer of 2021 created my first blog.

Currently I am looking for work as a data analyst, data scientist, or a machine learning engineer. My hope is that this blog will showcase my technical skills in these areas, determination, adaptability, and perseverance.
