In this tutorial I will be taking the functions I created in my previous post, [Creating Functions in R to Scrape NBA Data](), and putting them in my own ballR package. The goal here is to streamline the data scrapping process into a couple lines of code for future analysis. 

# 1. Github Repository 

# 2. File Structure 


1, 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39
