Today was pretty low key. So far the highlight of my day was watching Detroiters with my partner, Tanner. My favorite line from an episode we watched was, "Tell your Dad 'What's Up Doc' for me".

I also worked on this blog and finished the *Math and Statistics* lesson from a Linkedin Learn class on Python for Data Science. Tomorrow I'm planning to make more blog posts, maybe build out another portion of this blog, and maybe do another lesson (or at least another video) from that Linkedin Learn series.

Unfortunately a lot of my day was spent working, which can be frustrating. My coworker wants me to take over certain duties for this product, but is clearly having issues letting go. What I've learned today is that I need to always be thinking about how I can take all the "work" I do and minimize it down into one sentence.
