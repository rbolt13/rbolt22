Tomorrow I’m planning to make more blog posts, maybe build out another portion of this blog, and maybe do another lesson (or at least another video) from that Linkedin Learn series.\nUnfortunately a lot of my day was spent working, which can be frustrating. My coworker wants me to take over certain duties for this product, but is clearly having issues letting go. What I’ve learned today is that I need to always be thinking about how I can take all the “work” I do and minimize it down into one sentence."
