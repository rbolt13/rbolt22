Similarly both the beam and cylinders have approximately 15% of the data outside the normal distribution. An obvious difference between the two is that the beam data was more skewed than the cylinder. A reason for this may be that the range of values for the beam is smaller than the range of values for cylinders, so the beam mean is more sensitive to outlying data."

Calculate the trimmed mean for each sample by deleting the smallest and largest observation. What are the corresponding trimming percentages? How do the values of these trimmed means compare to the corresponding means and medians?\nTo start I will sort the data to see what are the largest and smallest observations for both.\n\nsort(urban)\n\n [1]  4  5  5  6 11 17 18 23 33 35 80\n\nsort(farm)\n\n [1]  0.3  2.0  3.0  4.0  4.0  5.0  8.0  8.9  9.0  9.0  9.2 11.0 14.0 20.0 21.0\n\n\nFrom the sorted data I can see the lowest and highest values for urban are c(4,80), and for farm they are c(0.3,21). These values are removed from the urban.trim and farm.trim shown below.\n\nurban.trim <- c(6.0, 5.0, 11.0, 33.0, 5.0, 18.0, 35.0, 17.0, 23.0)\nfarm.trim <- c(4.0, 14.0, 11.0, 9.0, 9.0, 8.0, 4.0, 20.0, 5.0, 8.9, 9.2, 3.0, 2.0)\n\nTo find the corresponding trimming percentages I subtracted the sum of the subtracted values from the sums of the urban and farm data sets respectively, and then divide each by the length of each data set respectively.\n\n(sum(urban)-84)/length(urban)\n\n[1] 13.90909\n\n(sum(farm)-21.3)/length(farm)\n\n[1] 7.14\n\n\nThe two values removed from the urban dataset is about 14% of the data, slightly more then the 7.14% variation of the farm data set.\nNow to look at the trimmed means.\n\nmean(urban.trim)\n\n[1] 17\n\nmean(farm.trim)\n\n[1] 8.238462\n\n\nThe trimmed mean of the urban data is closer to the median of the urban data, whereas the trimmed mean for the farm data is farther away from the mean and median of the untrimmed data. After this analysis it would seem that trimming the first data set may be appropriate, whereas trimming the second may lead to misleading data. Looking at the stem-and-leaf displays are helpful in visualizing distributions and outliers.\n\nstem(urban, scale = 2)\n\n\n  The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the |\n\n  0 | 4556\n  1 | 178\n  2 | 3\n  3 | 35\n  4 | \n  5 | \n  6 | \n  7 | \n  8 | 0\n\nstem(farm, scale = .5)\n\n\n  The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the |\n\n  0 | 02344589999\n  1 | 14\n  2 | 01"

Compute the fourth spread for each sample and compare. Do the fourth spreads convey the same message about variability that the standard deviations do? Explain.\nThe quickest way to do this in r is with quantile().\n\nquantile(urban)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n 4.0  5.5 17.0 28.0 80.0 \n\nquantile(farm)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n 0.3  4.0  8.9 10.1 21.0 \n\n\nExplanation : coming soon\nAnother way to find the forth spread is by first computing the upper fourth and lower fourth . To do that I first sorted the data, and then split it in half.
