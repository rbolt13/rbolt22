    "text": "I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Portland State University in 2022 with an emphasis on statistics. Since most of my undergrad was during COVID-19 lock down I‚Äôve become proficient at collaborating remotely. I ran remote study groups through discord, participated in the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) club, spoke virtually at G.I.S. in Action, and in the summer of 2021 created my first blog.\nCurrently I am looking for work as a data analyst, data scientist, or a machine learning engineer. My hope is that this blog will not only showcase my technical skills in these areas, but also my determination, adaptability, and perseverance.\n\nPersonal\nü©∞ Before I went to back to school to get my degree in mathematics I was a dancer. I have trained pre-professionally at Dance Vision and The SanFrancisco Conservatory of Dance. My favorite dance styles are ballet, hip-hop, and modern, but I love all kinds of dance and will try any form of movement. I unfortunately an not able to dance as much anymore due to a car accident in 2014 which required me to have two separate jaw surgeries in 2016 and 2017.\nüáØüáµ In high school I took Japanese, and have been appreciative of the culture ever since. Recently I bought plane tickets to visit Japan for the first time for my 30th birthday in 2023. While I‚Äôd still consider myself a beginner at speaking, writing, and reading the language, I am very much looking forward to the experience.\nüèÄ I enjoy most sports, but especially soccor and basketball. It‚Äôs a great way to do hobby statistics, and get rowdy üòú. Growing up both of my sisters, and dad played basketball so I watched a lot of games, and I still enjoy watching the NBA and WNBA. My favorite NBA teams are the Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, and New Orleans Pelicans.\nüéÆ I have a switch, and when I am not working on my blog I play Stardew Valley, Cat Cafe Manager, Unpacking, Mario Carts, Pokemon Legends Arceus, Animal Crossing, Just Dance, and most recently Pokemon Scarlet.\n\nüìöBooks I‚Äôm Currently Readingüìö\nBasketball Analytics\nEtiquette Guide to Japan\nWeapons of Math Destruction\n\nüé∂Music I‚Äôm Currently Listening Toüé∂\nFace Your Fears - Crazy Ex Girlfriend\nI Owe You Nothing\nNever Thought - Mel Bryant\nPudgy - Smino\nSupremacy - Muse\n\nüé•Movies I‚Äôve Watched Recentlyüé•\nPearl\nX\nHellraiser (Remake, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\nThe Father"
