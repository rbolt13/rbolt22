Your proof should be your own work, so you should not use any other resources. Record a short presentation or create a slide show explaining your proof. Make sure that you clearly state any definitions, axioms, or theorems that you are using._\n\n## Suppose two angles are verticle. \n\nProve that they are congruent. \n\n---\n\n# `1.` Definitions\n\nBefore hopping into our proof, lets look at a few definitions with some [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry) images. \n\n## `1.1` Vertical Angles\n\nIn class we defined vertical angles as being \"across from each other\". \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Fig. 1: ** Vertical angles are shown in pink.](../../00_img/q1_img1.png){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see a simple example of this in **Fig. 1** where a pair of pink angles $\\angle AOB$ and $\\angle COD$ are vertical to each other. \n\nNote that $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle BOD$ are vertical angles as well.\n\n## `1.2` Congruence\n\n$x\\cong y$ if there is an $\\underline{\\text{isometry}}$ that superimposes x onto y. \n\n- Isometry is a map that preserves distance and angles \n\n  - translation (move without turning)\n  \n  - rotation (moving about a fixed point)\n  \n  - reflection (mirror)\n  \n  - combination \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Fig. 2: ** Two congruent triangles](../../00_img/q1_img3.png){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn **Fig. 2** we see the two triangles are congruent, and would only need a translation isometry or two to map $\\triangle ABC$ onto $\\triangle A_1B_1C_1$.\n\n## `1.3` Supplementary Angles\n\nWe defined supplementary angles as angles whose measurement adds up to $180^\\circ$.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Fig. 3: **Supplementary angles are shown in pink and orange.](../../00_img/q1_img2.png){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n In **Fig.3** we can clearly see that $m\\angle AOC$ shown in pink and $m\\angle AOB$ in orange adds to a straight line or $180^\\circ$. We can also see three other pairs of supplementary angles: \n\n- $m\\angle AOB+m\\angle BOD=180^\\circ$\n\n- $m\\angle BOD+m\\angle COD=180^\\circ$\n\n- $m\\angle COD+m\\angle AOC=180^\\circ$\n\n# `2.` Theroems\n\nIncluded are the axioms and theorems used to prove that two vertical angles are congruent. \n\n## `2.1` Axioms of Angle Measure\n\n1. Right angle measures $90^\\circ$\n\n2. $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle CBA$\n\n3. If D is the interior of $\\angle ABC$, then $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD+m\\angle BDC$\n\n4. There exists a **unique** ray that is the angle bisector of $\\angle ABC$. \n\n## `2.2` Congruence and Angle Measure theorem\n\n$\\angle ABC\\cong \\angle DEF \\Leftrightarrow m\\angle ABC=m\\angle DEF$\n\n1. If two angles are congruent then the measure of those two angles is the same. \n\n2. If the measure of two angles is the same, then those two angles are congruent. \n\n(Note that the measure for angles that will be used on the proof will be in degrees. )\n\n## `2.3` Supplementary Interior Angle Theorem \n\nIf two lines are parallel then the supplementary interior angles add to $180^\\circ$. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Fig. 4: ** Supplementary interior angles are shown in red.](../../00_img/q1_img4.png){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn **Fig. 4** the supplementary interior angles $\\angle AEF$ and $\\angle CFE$ are shown in red and add up to $180^\\circ$. \n\n# `3.` Proof\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![**Fig. 1: **Two intesecting lines segments form vertical angles, shown in pink.](../../00_img/q1_img1.png){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo prove that two vertical angles are congruent, we need to prove two things :\n\n1. $\\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD\\Rightarrow m\\angle AOB = m\\angle COD$\n\n2. $m\\angle AOB = m\\angle COD\\Rightarrow \\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD$\n\n$\\underline{\\text{Proof}}$: \n\n1. $\\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD\\Rightarrow m\\angle AOB = m\\angle COD$\n\nSuppose $\\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD$. \n\nThen there is an isometry that superimposes $\\angle AOB$ onto $\\angle COD$. \n\nLet $f$ be that isometry : $f(\\angle AOB)=\\angle COD$.\n\nIsometries preserve angle. \n\nThe angle measure of $f(\\angle AOB)$ equals the angle measure of $\\angle COD$. \n\nSo by substitution $m\\angle AOB=m\\angle COD$. \n\n2. $m\\angle AOB = m\\angle COD\\Rightarrow \\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD$\n\nSuppose $m\\angle AOB = m\\angle COD$. \n\nSince by definition of vertical angles, $\\angle AOB$ and $\\angle COD$ are across from each other, there is a reflection, $f(m\\angle AOB)$ about the origin (O). \n\nWe also know that there are four pairs of supplementary angles, two of which are: \n\n- $m\\angle AOB+m\\angle BOD=180^\\circ$\n\n- $m\\angle BOD+m\\angle COD=180^\\circ$\n\nSo, $m\\angle AOB+m\\angle BOD=m\\angle BOD+m\\angle COD$. \n\nAnd if we subtract $m\\angle BOD$ from both sides we get, $m\\angle AOB=m\\angle COD$. \n\nIt would then make sense that $f(O)=O$, $f(A)=C$, and $f(B)=D$. \n\nThen by definition of reflection $f(m\\angle AOB)=m\\angle COD$. \n\nTherefore by the Congruence and Angle measure theorem $\\angle AOB\\cong \\angle COD$.\n\n$\\square$\n\n",
