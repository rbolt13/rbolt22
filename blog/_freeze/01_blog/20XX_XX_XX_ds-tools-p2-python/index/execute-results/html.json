Display the results in the same row. \n\n\n# `15.` Show all allergies ordered by popularity. Remove 'NKA' or NULL values from query. \n\n\n# `16.` Show all of the days of the month (1-31) and how many admission_dates occurred on that day. Sort by the day with most admissions to least admissions. \n\n\n# `17.` For every admission, display the patient's full name, their admission diagnosis, and their doctor's full name who diagnosed their problem. \n\n# `18.` From the patients table, show patient_id, weight, height, and isObese. Display isObese as a boolean 0 or 1. Obese is defined as weight(kg)/height(m)$^2$)>= 30. Weight is in units kg, and height in in units cm. \n\n# `19.` For each day display the total amount of admissions on that day. Display the amount changed from the previous date. \n\n\n# `20.` Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance. Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group. \n\n\n\t\n",
