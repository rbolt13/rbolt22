It is a calm, patient, and family friendly show, that encourages everyone to enjoy painting. \n\nLets **consider a viewer** who is **new to painting**, and wants to explore its joy by watching a season of \"The Joy of Painting\", and following along. This viewer is **budget conscious** and might be **disappointed to spend money on paint supplies that are hardly used**. This analysis considers this use case by investigating the frequency of colors used across seasons.   \n\n### Libraries\n\nThis analysis will only use packages from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data\n\nThis analysis will only use the Bob Ross data set that is included in TidyTuesday for February 2023. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbob_ross <- read_csv(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwilber/Bob_Ross_Paintings/master/data/bob_ross_paintings.csv\",\n) \nhead(bob_ross)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 28\n   ...1 painting…¹ img_src paint…² season episode num_c…³ youtu…⁴ colors color…⁵\n  <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>   <chr>    <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>  <chr>  \n1     1        282 https:… A Walk…      1       1       8 https:… \"['Al… ['#4E1…\n2     2        283 https:… Mt.

Each season has the same amount of episodes, so the user might consider viewing the paintings from each season, and deciding which season of paintings they like best before selecting the color they will purchase. They will enjoy painting more if they know they will enjoy the end result. \n\n2. Season 1 uses the least amount of colors, and might be a good place to start for someone who is new to painting, and cannot otherwise decide which seasons paintings they enjoy the most. \n\n3. Consider using similar colors interchangeably such as <font color=\"#5F2E1F\"> Dark Sienna </font> instead of <font color=\"#8A3324\"> Burnt Umber </font> and <font color=\"#CD5C5C\"> Indian Red </font>. The user might need to mix in more black or white, to get a similar result to the painting they are recreating, which is another thing to consider when purchasing supplies. \n\n### Discussion \n\n**What other questions would our given use case be curious about answering before investing their time into \"The Joy of Painting\"?**\n\n* Should they buy more of one paint (such as black and white) over others (such as purple)? \n\n* Is there any correlation between painting title and colors used? \n\n* What clusters of paintings use similar color palettes?\n\n**What are some other use cases for this data?**\n\n* An event planner who wants to pick one painting with the least amount of colors and complexity to paint with a group of people of varying experience levels. \n\n* An experienced painter who wants to wants to work with the most colors possible. \n\n* A homeowner who wants to recreate a painting with colors that will compliment their interier design choices. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
