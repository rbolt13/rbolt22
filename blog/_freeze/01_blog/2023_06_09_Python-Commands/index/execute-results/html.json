These commands will help you set up isolated environments for your Python projects, ensuring clean and organized development. \n\nThe information provided here is based on the YouTube video titled \"[Python Tutorial: VENV (Mac & Linux) - How to Use Virtual Environments with the Built-In venv Module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1Yvry_Ydk)\" by [Corey Schafer](http://coreyms.com/).\n\nNote: Remember not to commit the virtual environment (venv) and include it in the .gitignore file. However, do commit the requirements.txt file for package version control.\n\nLet's dive into the essential Python commands:\n\n# 1. Checking Installed Packages in the Global Environment\n\nTo view the list of packages installed on your machine in the global environment, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npip3 list\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# 2. Creating a Virtual Environment\n\nTo create a virtual environment, use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npython3 -m venv project_name\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 3. Creating a Virtual Environment in a Project Folder\n\nIt's important to avoid placing your project files within the virtual environment. Instead, create the virtual environment in a project folder by executing the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npython3 -m venv project_folder/project_name\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 4. Activating the Virtual Environment\n\nTo activate the virtual environment, run the appropriate command based on your operating system:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nactivate virtual enviroment\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 5. Checking the Python Version in the Virtual Environment\n\nTo determine the Python version being used within the virtual environment, use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nwhich python\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 6. Checking Installed Packages in the Virtual Environment\n\nTo view the packages installed within the virtual environment, execute the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip list\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 7. Installing Packages in the Virtual Environment\n\nTo install packages within the virtual environment, use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip install package_name\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 8. Creating a File of Packages and Versions\n\nTo create a file containing a list of installed packages and their versions, use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 9. Installing Packages from a Requirements File\n\nTo install packages from a requirements file, execute the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 10. Deactivating the Virtual Environment\n\nTo deactivate the virtual environment and return to the global environment, use the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ndeactivate \n```\n:::\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThese basic Python commands provide a solid foundation for managing virtual environments and package installations. By utilizing virtual environments, you can isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent and reproducible development environments. Remember to create and commit a requirements.txt file for version control of your project's dependencies, while excluding the virtual environment itself from version control.\n",
