(Logistical Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Tree)\n\n**Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data for analysis such as identifying hidden patterns in clustering, association, and anomalies or errors. (K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering)\n\n# `2.` What is the difference between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis?\n\n**Univariate**: Looks at only one variable at a time. \n\n**Bivariate**: Compares two variables. \n\n**Multivariate**: Compares more than two variables. \n\n# `3.` What is the difference between wide format data and long format data?\n\n**Wide Format Data**: Has a column for each variable. \n\n**Long Format Data**: Has a column for possible variable types, and a value for each of those variables. \n\n# `4.` What is the difference between normalization and stadardization?\n\n**Normalization**: Rescales the values into a range of [0,1].\n\n**Standardization**: Rescales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \n\n# `5.` What is variance? \n\n**Variance**: $s^2=\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})}{n-1}$ is a measure of spread within the data. \n\n# `6.` What is a normal distribution? \n\n**Normal distribution**: (Gaussian distribution or bell curve) is a probability distribution that is symmetrical about the mean. \n\n# `7.` What is the law of large numbers?\n\n**Law of Large Numbers**: if an experiment is repeated independently a large number of times then the average results of the obtained results should be close to the expected value. \n\n# `8.` What is the goal of A/B testing?\n\nTo determine which experiment A or B preformed better. \n\n# `9.` You are given a dataset consisting of variables with more than 30 percent missing values. How do you deal with them?\n\n1. Delete rows or columns with missing values. This can be problematic if it means loosing valuable data. \n\n2. Fill in the missing values with an approximation of the average of the other values in the column. \n\n# `10.` For the given points how do you calculate the Euclidean distance in Python?\n\npoint 1 = (2,3) and point 2 = (1,1)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n \n# initializing points in numpy arrays\npoint1 = np.array((1, 2, 3))\npoint2 = np.array((1, 1, 1))\n \n# calculating Euclidean distance using linalg.norm()\ndist = np.linalg.norm(point1 - point2)\n \n# printing Euclidean distance\nprint(dist)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n2.23606797749979\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote: Check out the [distance package](https://github.com/rbolt13/distance) I created to solve this same problem using R. \n\n# `11.` How do you find RMSE and MSE in a linear regression model?\n\n**Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: $\\text{RMSE}=\\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}=\\sqrt\\frac{\\sum{(y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2}}{n}$\n\n**Mean Square Error (MSE)**: $\\text{MSE}=\\frac{\\sum{(\\text{observed}-\\text{predicted})^2}}{n}=\\frac{\\sum{(y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2}}{n}$\n\nNote: The values are squared is to prevent negative values, and to increase the impact of of larger errors. \n\n# `12.` What is the significance of p-value?\n\nThe p value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Meaning there is no statistical significance that exists between variables.  \n\nWhen p is $\\leq$ 0.05 then we can reject the null hypothesis. \n\nWhen p is > 0.05 then we fail to reject the null hypothesis aka accept it.\n\n",
