Most of these are based off examples given on [djnavarro's github](https://github.com/djnavarro/jasmines). \n\n![](../../00_img/me.png)\n\n# `1. Set-Up`\n\nI will be using jasmines to create art, and dplyr to pipe the code. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(jasmines)\nlibrary(dplyr) \n```\n:::\n\n\n# `2. Randi`\n\nWhen playing around with this package, I initially had something less fluid and full of right angles, but wanted to show more movement in the design. I have a dance background and aside from fluid movement we also focused a lot on circles and rotation. Another reason I like this design is because it reminds me of a flower. I have seven tattoos, two of which are flowers. The two colors I chose are salmon and rosewood. I enjoy different shades of pink, and colors like salmon, and rosewood feel like a more sophisticated pink to me.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuse_seed(5) %>%\n  entity_circle(grain = 1000, size = 10) %>%\n  unfold_warp(iterations = 100) %>%\n  style_ribbon(\n    color = \"#9E4244\",\n    background = \"#FDAB9F\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# `3.
